= Goal Graphs

This CLI app helps you meet your goals by plotting your progress.

== Usage

Create an index toml file.
Add a section like the following to it:

.index.toml
[source,toml]
----
[[goals]]
name = "Weight"
aim = "decrease"
goal = 90.0

# Data files should be relative to `index.toml`
data = "lose-weight.csv"
----

You can add as many `[[goals]]` sections as you like.

Track your data in a CSV file for a few days:

.lose-weight.csv
[source,csv]
----
day,weight (kg)
2018w01pa,92.4
2018w02mu,91.5
2018w03ze,90.4
2018w04pa,91.5
2018w04re,92.9
2018w04ci,91.3
----

And then run the program by passing it `index.toml`!

== QA

----
What's up with the dates formatted like `2018w05blah`?
----

Oh!
Sorry.
I like to think in terms of weeks and days, so I started using the date format `<YYYY>w<week number><day number>`.

The `pa`, `re`, `ci` words are numbers in link:http://www.languagesandnumbers.com/how-to-count-in-lojban/en/jbo/[lojban].

Days are numbered from `pa` to `ze`; `pa` being monday, `ze` being Sunday.

Right now this is the only format that is accepted, but I plan on allowing regular dates soon™.
